A group of warriors in dark clothes are fighting a flock of gargoyles. There are clouds of sorcerous mist in the hallway behind their backs. Suddenly, it's pierced by a ray of light, and the familiar wizard appears on the battlefield, holding a magic lantern in his hand. He is swaying from pain, but looks angry and resolute.{/n}"

To the second floor!\" {n}He lights the lantern, and the warriors swiftly retreat into the mist.{/n}"
