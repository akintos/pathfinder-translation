Not the ancient death of the chieftain himself, but recent death — dismembered bodies are scattered around the room, the blood staining and pooling on the floor. You barely even recognize the remains as human — they were once members of the {g|Tiger Lords}Tiger Lords{/g}, the barbarians who followed their leader to this tomb, only to fall by his hand. Armag himself stands in the center of the room, clenching a bloodstained sword. He breathes heavily, like a hunted animal, his eyes wild and aimless. His voice is hoarse as he shouts at a slim woman in a gray cloak in short, abrupt phrases. The woman's yellow eyes are fearless as she watches the chieftain through the holes in the veil that covers her face.{/n}"
