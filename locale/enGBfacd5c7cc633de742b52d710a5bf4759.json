Perhaps one day it will occur to Baron Varn or the General to mention me in their memoirs... For surely our encounter must have made an impression upon them as well!"

As they draw near, the warriors strike in unison, throwing all their might into a single, precise and deadly attack. The wounded beast roars, and tries to escape under the ground!"

Its flight has the doom of inevitability, and it disappears into the unyielding earth."

But they learn that the centaur belongs to the Nomen tribe, and their leader is one Aecora Silverfire, a name Roiko speaks with the fiery awe of youth. The Nomen centaurs consider themselves guardians of this land, and stand ready to defend it from any invasion. Roiko also tells them, with a sigh, that the tribe is very small, unlike in the olden days. War and disaster has taken their toll, and the other tribes no longer want to deal with the Nomen. Roiko's words make it seem as though the other centaur tribes consider his own tribe perhaps a little... mad."

      "Value": "The centaur says his name is Roiko, but it sounds more like a nickname than a real one. He is manifestly stunned by the courage of Baron Varn and his people.
